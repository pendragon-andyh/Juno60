##Juno 60
All 6 voices are processed through the same high-pass filter. The slider for the cut-off frequency has only 4 positions:

| Slider position | Cut-off frequency |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | No filtering applied |
| 1 | Cutoff 6db per octave below 154 Hz |
| 2 | Cutoff 6db per octave below 339 Hz |
| 3 | Cutoff 6db per octave below 720 Hz |

Note: The cut-off frequencies above were worked-out by calculating F=1/(2*pi*C*R).

#Juno 106
The Juno 106 is a little different. The slider has only 4 positions, but position 0 boosts the base frequencies, and position 1 has no filtering:

| Slider position | Cut-off frequency |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Bass is boosted below 65 Hz by 6dB (low-shelf) |
| 1 | No filtering applied |
| 2 | Cutoff 6db per octave below 225 Hz |
| 3 | Cutoff 6db per octave below 720 Hz |

#Juno 6
All 6 voices are processed through the same high-pass filter. The slider for the cut-off frequency has a full range of values.

Not measured, and not specified in Service Notes. However, the earlier Jupiter 4 had a range of 40Hz to 5kHz.
