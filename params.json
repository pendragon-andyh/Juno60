{"name":"Juno60","tagline":"Analysis of Roland Juno60 sound","body":"#Juno60\r\n##Introduction\r\nThis project aims to analyse the sound of Roland's [Juno 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Juno-60) synthesizor with the eventual aim of recreating its distinctive sounds using the [Web Audio API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/).\r\n\r\nI decomposed the Juno 60 into the following functional areas so that I can analyse each in isolation:\r\n* [DCO](DCO/) -\r\n    [Sawtooth](DCO/Sawtooth/),\r\n    [PWM](DCO/PWM/),\r\n    [Sub oscillator](DCO/Sub/),\r\n    [Noise](DCO/Noise/),\r\n    [Mix down](DCO/Mixdown/)\r\n* [Envelope](Envelope/) -\r\n    [Attack](Envelope/Attack/),\r\n    [Decay](Envelope/Decay/),\r\n    [Release](Envelope/Release/),\r\n    [PWM modulation](Envelope/PWM/),\r\n    [LPF modulation](Envelope/LPF/)\r\n* TBC\r\n\r\n##Testing\r\nThe test plan is documented [here](TestPlan/). Most of my analysis was carried-out using the brilliant [Sonic Visualiser](http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/) software.\r\n\r\n##Resources\r\nI found the following resources helpful for understanding the analogue synths.\r\n* [URLs for Juno 60](Resources/Juno60/)\r\n* [URLs for Juno 106](Resources/Juno106/) - has almost identical sound engine.\r\n* [Books](Resources/Books/)\r\n* [Web Audio API](Resources/WebAudioAPI/)\r\n\r\nAny mistakes and misinterpretations are entirely my fault.\r\n\r\n##Licensing\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Andy Harman and Pendragon Software Limited.\r\n\r\nReleased under the [MIT license](MIT-LICENSE.md).
