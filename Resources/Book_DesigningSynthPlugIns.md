#[Resources](README.md) > Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-ins in C++: For RackAFX, VST3, and Audio Units
By Will Pirkle

ISBN: 978-1-315-76685-0 - [Amazon](www.amazon.co.uk/TODO)

##Summary
This book is aimed at C++ developers who want to write plug-ins for the RackAFX, VST3 and Audio Units APIs. However, it contains a wealth of information about implementing synthesisor modules in code.

The book is greatly influenced by Bill Jenkins and Andy Learly (who both work as Software Engineers for Korg).

##Highlights
###Chapter 6 - Envelope generators and Controlled Amplifiers
This chapter contains a superb description of how analog envelopes work - and how to correctly model them.

##Notes
I have the eBook version of this book. Often the diagrams do not appear on the same page as the text that references them. The paperback version may be easier to use.

Some of the techniques (especially the filters) will only become truely possible in the Web Audio API when we get the AudioWorkerNode.
