#[Analysis](../../README.md) > [Envelope](../README.md) > Gate

##Duration
The "Gate" setting on the VCA causes a very simple envelope to be applied to the tone:
* Attack = 0.003 seconds
* Release = 0.006 seconds

This is probably done to avoid clicks in the output.

##Slope
Same as the normal envelope [attack](../Attack/README.md) and [release](../Release/README.md).
